timer:
  # When calling the start service on a timer that is already running, it resets 
  # the duration it will need to finish and restart the timer without triggering 
  # a canceled or finished event. This, for example, makes it easy to create 
  # timed lights that get triggered by motion. Starting a timer triggers a 
  # started event unless the timer is paused, in that case, it triggers a 
  # restarted event.
