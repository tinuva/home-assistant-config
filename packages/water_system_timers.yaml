# timer:
#   # When calling the start service on a timer that is already running, it resets
#   # the duration it will need to finish and restart the timer without triggering
#   # a canceled or finished event. This, for example, makes it easy to create
#   # timed lights that get triggered by motion. Starting a timer triggers a
#   # started event unless the timer is paused, in that case, it triggers a
#   # restarted event.
