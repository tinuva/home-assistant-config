#timer:
#  # When calling the start service on a timer that is already running, it resets
#  # the duration it will need to finish and restart the timer without triggering
#  # a canceled or finished event. This, for example, makes it easy to create
#  # timed lights that get triggered by motion. Starting a timer triggers a
#  # started event unless the timer is paused, in that case, it triggers a
#  # restarted event.
